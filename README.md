## Who am I?
😄 I'm **Alice**, or *Macs*, a developer & composer from Italy.

👩🏻‍💻 I've been programming since 2015 and composing since 2018. During these years I've started working as a developer and have been making games.

🎮 In 2020 I started CheironMC, which went on to become one of Italy's most groundbreaking Minecraft Roleplay servers. CheironMC was closed down in 2022 because of me starting MacsWorks and general player uninterest.

🗂️ Currently CEO @ MacsWorks, one of the leading experts in Minecraft Plugin development, with more than 300 completed projects.

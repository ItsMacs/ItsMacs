# Hi, I'm Alice (Macs)!

## Who am I?
😄 I'm **Alice**, or *Macs*, a backend developer from Italy.

👩🏻‍💻 I've been programming since 2015, when I started testing the Unity Engine to make small games. During these years I've started working as a developer and have been making games and started working full-time on Java applications, specifically on Minecraft.

🎮 In 2020 I started CheironMC, which went on to become one of Italy's biggest Minecraft Roleplay servers. CheironMC was closed down in 2022 because of me starting to work full-time..
